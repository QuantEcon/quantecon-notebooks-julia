    "### Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "A topic of interest for economics and many other disciplines is *ranking*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s now consider one of the most practical and important ranking problems\n",
    "— the rank assigned to web pages by search engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Although the problem is motivated from outside of economics, there is in fact a deep connection between search ranking systems and prices in certain competitive equilibria — see [[DLP13]](../zreferences.html#dlp2013))\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the issue, consider the set of results returned by a query to a web search engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the user, it is desirable to\n",
    "\n",
    "1. receive a large set of accurate matches  \n",
    "1. have the matches returned in order, where the order corresponds to some measure of “importance”  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ranking according to a measure of importance is the problem we now consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology developed to solve this problem by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin\n",
    "is known as [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank).\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the idea, consider the following diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"_static/figures/web_graph.png\" style=\"width:60%;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "Imagine that this is a miniature version of the WWW, with\n",
    "\n",
    "- each node representing a web page  \n",
    "- each arrow representing the existence of a link from one page to another  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s think about which pages are likely to be important, in the sense of being valuable to a search engine user.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible criterion for importance of a page is the number of inbound links — an indication of popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "By this measure, `m` and `j` are the most important pages, with 5 inbound links each.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if the pages linking to `m`, say, are not themselves important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking this way, it seems appropriate to weight the inbound nodes by relative importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PageRank algorithm does precisely this.\n",
    "\n",
    "A slightly simplified presentation that captures the basic idea is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Letting $ j $ be (the integer index of) a typical page and $ r_j $ be its ranking, we set\n",
    "\n",

    "- $ \\ell_i $ is the total number of outbound links from $ i $  \n",
    "- $ L_j $ is the set of all pages $ i $ such that $ i $ has a link to $ j $  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a measure of the number of inbound links, weighted by their own ranking (and normalized by $ 1 / \\ell_i $).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is, however, another interpretation, and it brings us back to Markov chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ P $ be the matrix given by $ P(i, j) = \\mathbf 1\\{i \\to j\\} / \\ell_i $ where $ \\mathbf 1\\{i \\to j\\} = 1 $ if $ i $ has a link to $ j $ and zero otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix $ P $ is a stochastic matrix provided that each page has at least one link.\n",

    "With this definition of $ P $ we have\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing $ r $ for the row vector of rankings, this becomes $ r = r P $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence $ r $ is the stationary distribution of the stochastic matrix $ P $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s think of $ P(i, j) $ as the probability of “moving” from page $ i $ to page $ j $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value $ P(i, j) $ has the interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ P(i, j) = 1/k $ if $ i $ has $ k $ outbound links, and $ j $ is one of them  \n",
    "- $ P(i, j) = 0 $ if $ i $ has no direct link to $ j $  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, motion from page to page is that of a web surfer who moves from one page to another by randomly clicking on one of the links on that page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here “random” means that each link is selected with equal probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $ r $ is the stationary distribution of $ P $, assuming that the uniform ergodicity condition is valid, we [can interpret](#new-interp-sd) $ r_j $ as the fraction of time that a (very persistent) random surfer spends at page $ j $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your exercise is to apply this ranking algorithm to the graph pictured above,\n",
    "and return the list of pages ordered by rank.\n",
