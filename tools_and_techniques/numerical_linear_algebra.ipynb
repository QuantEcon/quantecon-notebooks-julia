    "In this lecture, we examine the structure of matrices and linear operators (e.g., dense, sparse, symmetric, tridiagonal, banded) and\n",

    "\n",
    "We build on applications discussed in previous lectures: [linear algebra](linear_algebra.html), [orthogonal projections](orth_proj.html), and [Markov chains](finite_markov.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods in this section are called direct methods, and they are qualitatively similar to performing Gaussian elimination to factor matrices and solve systems of equations.  In [iterative methods and sparsity](iterative_methods_sparsity.html) we examine a different approach, using iterative algorithms, where we can think of more general linear operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of specialized packages for these tasks is enormous and growing, but some of the important organizations to\n",

    "1. **Do not lose structure** by applying the wrong numerical linear algebra operations at the wrong times (e.g., sparse matrix becoming dense)  \n",

As we saw in the answer to the questions above, the algorithm - and hence the computational complexity - changes based on matrix structure.\n",

    "While this notion of complexity can work at various levels, such as the number of [significant digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_of_mathematical_operations#Arithmetic_functions) for basic mathematical operations, the amount of memory and storage required, or the amount of time, we will typically focus on the time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For time complexity, the size $ N $ is usually the dimensionality of the problem, although occasionally the key will be the number of non-zeros in the matrix or the width of bands.  For our applications, time complexity is best thought of as the number of floating point operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) required."

    "#### Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity of algorithms is typically written in [Big O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) notation, which provides bounds on the scaling of the computational complexity with respect to the size of the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, if the number of operations required for a problem size $ N $ is $ f(N) $, we  can write this as $ f(N) = O(g(N)) $ for some $ g(N) $ - typically a polynomial.\n",

    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that these are asymptotic results intended for understanding the scaling of the problem, and the constant can matter for a given\n",

Other methods of solving a linear system may have different constants of proportionality, even if they have the same scaling, $ O(N^3) $."

    "### Rules of Computational Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "You will sometimes need to think through how [combining algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Properties) changes complexity.  For example, if you use\n",
    "\n",
    "1. an $ O(N^3) $ operation $ P $ times, then it simply changes the constant. The complexity remains $ O(N^3) $.  \n",
    "1. one $ O(N^3) $ operation and one $ O(N^2) $ operation, then you take the max.  The complexity remains $ O(N^3) $.  \n",
    "1. a repetition of an $ O(N) $ operation that itself uses an $ O(N) $ operation, you take the product.  The complexity becomes $ O(N^2) $.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, we have an important word of caution: Dense-matrix multiplication is an [expensive operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_of_mathematical_operations#Matrix_algebra) for unstructured matrices.  The naive version is $ O(N^3) $ while the fastest-known algorithms (e.g., Coppersmith-Winograd) are roughly $ O(N^{2.37}) $.  In practice, it is reasonable to crudely approximate with $ O(N^3) $ when doing an analysis, in part since the higher constant factors of the better scaling algorithms dominate the better complexity until matrices become very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, modern libraries use highly tuned and numerically stable [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication_algorithm) to multiply matrices and exploit the computer architecture, memory cache, etc., but this simply lowers the constant of proportionality and they remain roughly approximated by  $ O(N^3) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "A consequence is that, since many algorithms require matrix-matrix multiplication, it is often not possible to go below that order without further matrix structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, changing the constant of proportionality for a given size can help, but in order to achieve better scaling you need to identify matrix structure (e.g., tridiagonal, sparse) and ensure that your operations do not lose it."

    "## Implementation Details and Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the famous quote from Knuth: “97% of the time, premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.”  The most common example of premature optimization is trying to use your own mental model of a compiler while writing your code, worried about the efficiency of code, and (usually incorrectly) second-guessing the compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, the lessons in this section are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Don’t worry about optimizing your code unless you need to.  Code clarity is your first-order concern.  \n",
    "1. If you use other people’s packages, they can worry about performance and you don’t need to.  \n",
    "1. If you absolutely need that “critical 3%,” your intuition about performance is usually wrong on modern CPUs and GPUs, so let the compiler do its job.  \n",
    "1. Benchmarking (e.g., `@btime`) and [profiling](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/profile/) are the tools to figure out performance bottlenecks.  If 99% of computing time is spent in one small function, then there is no point in optimizing anything else.  \n",
    "1. If you benchmark to show that a particular part of the code is an issue, and you can’t find another library that does a better job, then you can worry about performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You will rarely get to step 3, let alone step 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is also a corollary:  “don’t pessimize prematurely.” That is, don’t make choices that lead to poor performance without any tradeoff in improved code clarity.  For example, writing your own algorithms when a high-performance algorithm exists in a package or Julia itself, or lazily making a matrix dense and carelessly dropping its structure."

    "### Implementation Difficulty\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical analysts sometimes refer to the lowest level of code for basic operations (e.g., a dot product, matrix-matrix product, convolutions) as `kernels`.\n",
    "\n",
    "That sort of code is difficult to write, and performance depends on the characteristics of the underlying hardware, such as the [instruction set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture) available on the particular CPU, the size of the [CPU cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache), and the layout of arrays in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, these operations are written in a [BLAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms) library, organized into different levels.  The levels roughly correspond to the computational order of the operations:  BLAS Level 1 are $ O(N) $ operations such as linear products, Level 2 are $ O(N^2) $ operations such as matrix-vector products, and Level 3 are roughly $ O(N^3) $, such as general matrix-matrix products.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a BLAS library is [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS), which is used by default in Julia, or  the [Intel MKL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_Kernel_Library), which is used in Matlab (and in Julia if the `MKL.jl` package is installed).\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of BLAS are [LAPACK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK) operations, which are higher-level kernels, such as matrix factorizations and eigenvalue algorithms, and are often in the same libraries (e.g., MKL has both BLAS and LAPACK functionality).\n",
    "\n",
    "The details of these packages are not especially relevant, but if you are talking about performance, people will inevitably start discussing these different packages and kernels.  There are a few important things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Leave writing kernels to the experts.  Even simple-sounding algorithms can be very complicated to implement with high performance.  \n",
    "1. Your intuition about performance of code is probably going to be wrong.  If you use high quality libraries rather than writing your own kernels, you don’t need to use your intuition.  \n",
    "1. Don’t get distracted by the jargon or acronyms above if you are reading about performance.  "

    "### Row- and Column-Major Ordering\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a practical performance issue which may influence your code.  Since memory in a CPU is linear, dense matrices need to be stored by either stacking columns (called [column-major order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order)) or rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this matters is that compilers can generate better performance if they work in contiguous chunks of memory, and this becomes especially important with large matrices due to the interaction with the CPU cache.  Choosing the wrong order when there is no benefit in code clarity is an example of premature pessimization.  The performance difference can be orders of magnitude in some cases, and nothing in others.\n",
    "\n",
    "One option is to use the functions that let the compiler choose the most efficient way to traverse memory. If you need to choose the looping order yourself, then you might want to experiment with going through columns first and going through rows first.  Other times, let Julia decide, i.e., `enumerate` and `eachindex` will choose the right approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia, Fortran, and Matlab all use column-major order, while C/C++ and Python use row-major order.  This means that if you find an algorithm written for C/C++/Python, you will sometimes need to make small changes if performance is an issue."

    "This exercise is for practice on writing low-level routines (i.e., “kernels”), and to hopefully convince you to leave low-level code to the experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for matrix multiplication is deceptively simple.  For example, with the product of square matrices $ C = A B $ of size $ N \\times N $, the $ i,j $ element of $ C $ is\n",

    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C_{ij} = A_{i,:} \\cdot B_{:,j}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the inner product in a discrete space is simply a sum, and has the same complexity as the sum (i.e., $ O(N) $ operations).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a dense matrix without any structure and using a naive multiplication algorithm, this also makes it clear why the complexity is $ O(N^3) $: You need to evaluate it for $ N^2 $ elements in the matrix and do an $ O(N) $ operation each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, implement matrix multiplication yourself and compare performance in a few permutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the built-in function in Julia (i.e., `C = A * B`, or, for a better comparison, the in-place version `mul!(C, A, B)`, which works with pre-allocated data).  \n",
    "1. Loop over each $ C_{ij} $ by the row first (i.e., the `i` index) and use a `for` loop for the inner product.  \n",
    "1. Loop over each $ C_{ij} $ by the column first (i.e., the `j` index) and use a `for` loop for the inner product.  \n",
    "1. Do the same but use the `dot` product instead of the sum.  \n",
    "1. Choose your best implementation of these, and then for matrices of a few different sizes (`N=10`, `N=1000`, etc.), and compare the ratio of performance of your best implementation to the built-in BLAS library.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A few more hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can just use random matrices (e.g., `A = rand(N, N)`).  \n",
    "- For all of them, pre-allocate the $ C $ matrix beforehand with `C = similar(A)` or something equivalent.  \n",
