    "\n",
    "In continuous-time, there is an important distinction between randomness that leads to continuous paths vs. those which have ([almost surely right-continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A0dl%C3%A0g)) jumps in their paths.  The most tractable of these includes the theory of [Levy Processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9vy_process).\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the appealing features of Levy Processes is that they fit well into the sorts of Markov modeling techniques that economists tend to use in discrete time, and usually fulfill the measurability required for calculating expected present discounted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in discrete-time, where a modeller has license to be creative, the rules of continuous-time stochastic processes are much stricter.  In practice, there are only two types of Levy Processes that can be used without careful measure theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Weiner Processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process) (as known as Brownian Motion) which leads to a diffusion equations, and is the only continuous-time Levy process with continuous paths  \n",
    "1. [Poisson Processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process) with an arrival rate of jumps in the variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Every other Levy Process can be represented by these building blocks (e.g. a [Diffusion Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_process) such as Geometric Brownian Motion is a transformation of a Weiner process, a [jump diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_diffusion#In_economics_and_finance) is a diffusion process with a Poisson arrival of jumps, and a continuous-time markov chain (CMTC) is a Poisson process jumping between a finite number of states).\n",
