    "- Fundamentals  vary stochastically and are not fully observable  \n",
    "- At any moment there are both active and inactive entrepreneurs; only active entrepreneurs produce  \n",
    "- Agents – active and inactive entrepreuneurs –  have beliefs about the fundamentals expressed as probability distributions  \n",
    "- Greater uncertainty means greater dispersions of these distributions  \n",
    "- Entrepreneurs are risk averse and hence less inclined to be active  when uncertainty is high  \n",
    "- The output of active entrepreneurs is observable, supplying a noisy signal that helps everyone inside the model infer fundamentals  \n",
    "- Entrepreneurs update their beliefs about fundamentals using Bayes’ Law, implemented via [Kalman filtering](tools_and_techniques/kalman.ipynb)  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty traps emerge because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High uncertainty discourages entrepreneurs from becoming active  \n",
    "- A low level of participation – i.e., a smaller number of active entrepreneurs – diminishes the flow of information about fundamentals  \n",
    "- Less information translates to higher uncertainty, further discouraging entrepreneurs from choosing to be active, and so on  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty traps stem from a positive externality: high aggregate economic activity levels generates valuable information"
