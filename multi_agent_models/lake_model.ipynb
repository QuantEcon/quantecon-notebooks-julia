    "\n",
    "- flows between unemployment and employment  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good model for interpreting monthly labor department reports on gross and net jobs created and jobs destroyed\n",
    "\n",
    "The “lakes” in the model are the pools of employed and unemployed\n",
    "\n",
    "The “flows” between the lakes are caused by\n",
    "\n",
    "- firing and hiring  \n",
    "- entry and exit from the labor force  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first part of this lecture, the parameters governing transitions into\n",
    "and out of unemployment and employment are exogenous\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, we’ll determine some of these transition rates endogenously using the [McCall search model](dynamic_programming/mccall_model.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll also use some nifty concepts like ergodicity, which provides a fundamental link between *cross-sectional* and *long run time series* distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts will help us build an equilibrium model of ex ante homogeneous workers whose different luck generates variations in their ex post experiences"
