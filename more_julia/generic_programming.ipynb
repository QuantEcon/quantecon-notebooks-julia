    "> I find OOP methodologically wrong. It starts with classes. It is as if mathematicians would start with axioms. You do not start with axioms - you start with proofs. Only when you have found a bunch of related proofs, can you come up with axioms. You end with axioms. The same thing is true in programming: you have to start with interesting algorithms. Only when you understand them well, can you come up with an interface that will let them work. – Alexander Stepanov"

    "## Limitations of Dispatching on Abstract Types\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that types in Julia represent a tree with `Any` at the root\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree structure has worked well for the above examples, but it doesn’t allow us to associate multiple categorizations of types\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a semi-group type would be useful for a writing generic code (e.g.\n",
    "continuous-time solutions for ODEs and matrix-free methods), but cannot be\n",
    "implemented rigorously since the `Matrix` type is a semi-group as well\n",
    "as an `AbstractArray`, but not all semi-groups are `AbstractArray` s\n",
    "\n",
    "The main way to implement this in a generic language is with a design approach called “traits”\n",
    "\n",
    "- See the [original discussion](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/2345#issuecomment-54537633) and an [example of a package to facilitate the pattern](https://github.com/mauro3/SimpleTraits.jl)  \n",
    "- A complete description of the traits pattern as the natural evolution of Multiple Dispatch is given in this [blog post](https://white.ucc.asn.au/2018/10/03/Dispatch,-Traits-and-Metaprogramming-Over-Reflection.html)  "
